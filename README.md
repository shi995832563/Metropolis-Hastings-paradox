# Metropolis-Hastings-paradox
Source codes for "A paradox in Metropolis-Hastings practice"
1. toy_example.R is to generate a toy example to show the commonly expected pattern in running the Metropolis algorithm.
2. paradox_mvn.R is to show the paradox example in the multivariate normal distribution setting, together with the density variation probabilities calculated.
3. paradox_hnn.R is to show the paradox example in the hierarchical normal-normal model, together with the density variation probabilities calculated.
4. probability_illustration.R is to draw a figure to illustrate the regions of lower, higher densities in the process of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
5. main_lr.R is the main file for simulations for linear regression model with simulation_function_change2.R and linear_regression.R as its functions.
6. hnn_example.R is to carry out simulations for hierarchical normal-normal model.
7. main_hmm.R is the main file for simulations for hidden markov model with hmm.R as its function.
